# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here

A person can never just look at a place on the internet to determine whether or not it is a good place to post up and code. They have to go look through reviews on yelp and try to scroll through to find the information they need.

Imani is a web developer who works with a remote team. She enjoys getting out and being around people and so she is always looking to get out of the house to do so. She also has needs she needs to meet, like secure fast internet, in order to work with her coworkers. Finding this information out with 100% certainty before going somewhere is often a challenge.


#  Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

üö´These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Content Licenses

üö´For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table
